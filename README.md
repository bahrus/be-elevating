# be-elevating [TODO]

## Example 1a [TODO]

```html
<host-element>
    #shadow
        <input be-elevating='to host prop.'>
</host-element>
```

which is shorthand for:

## Example 1b [TODO]

```html
<host-element>
    #shadow
        <input be-elevating='of value to host prop.'>
</host-element>
```

What these two first examples do:  Pass the value of the input element to the hostProp property of the hot element on the change event.
